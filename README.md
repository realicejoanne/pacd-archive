# What is Digital Image Processing and Analysis?

This study is a continuous subject from [Computer Graphics study](https://github.com/realicejoanne/grafkom-archive). In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. We are not only processing it but also analysing.

Tools and packages:
1. Visual Studio 2017 or get the latest one
2. EmguCV
3. Luxand

In Digital Image Processing and Analysis, there are several subtopics I learned:
1. Introduction to Digital Image Processing and Analysis
2. Basics of Digital Image Processing: Pixels and its representations
3. Digital Image Processing Algorithms </br>
   a. Point Process - Brightness, Invert, Grayscale, Thresholding, Gamma Correction, Look-up Table, Histogram Equalization, Contrast Stretching </br>
   b. Area Process - Distance, Convolution, Spatial Filtering (Blurring, Sharpening, Edge Detection, Embossing), Erotion/Dilation </br>
   c. Geometry Process - Mapping (Forward & Reverse), Transformation (Scale, Rotate, Translate, Shear, Reflect, etc.), Interpolation </br>
   d. Frame Process - Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication, Logic Operations (AND/NAND, OR/XOR, etc.) </br>
4. Comparing Digital Images: Correlation, Distance Transform
5. How to use C# for Digital Image Processing in Visual Studio 2017
6. How to use EmguCV for Digital Image Processing in Visual Studio 2017
7. How to use Luxand for Digital Image Processing
8. Camera and Face Recognition
